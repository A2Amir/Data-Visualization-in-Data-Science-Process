# Explanatory analysis


This section, we'll focus on explanatory analysis, which is done when you communicate your findings to others.
These visualizations need to emphasize the key messages that you want the viewer to understand. Compared to **exploratory plots**, explanatory plots should be polished
so that their purpose is clear and easy to obtain.

In **explanatory analyses**, your audience will be broader and your goal will be to convey your findings to other people who don't have the level of hands-on experience with the data as you. Visualizations under this banner should be focused on **telling a specific story** that you want to convey to that particular audience. Many times, these visualizations evolve from visuals created during **the exploratory process**, just polished up to highlight the specific intended insights. These highlights might change depending on the audience you're presenting to. You'll revisit those design concepts from earlier to make your plots informative not just for yourself, but also compelling and understandable for others.

**Telling stories with data follows these steps:**

1. Start with a Question
2.  Repetition is a Good Thing
3.  Highlight the Answer
4.  Call Your Audience To Action
