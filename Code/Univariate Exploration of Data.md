# Univariate Exploration of Data

We start our exploration of a dataset with univariate visualizations or visualizations of single variables.By looking at one variable at a time, we can build an intuition for how each variable is distributed before moving on to more complicated interactions between variables. 

This sections will focus on two different plot types, **bar charts for qualitative variables** and **histograms for quantitative variables**.  While both of these plot types take the appearance of rectangles on a pair of axes, you will see how datatype makes these plots distinct.
