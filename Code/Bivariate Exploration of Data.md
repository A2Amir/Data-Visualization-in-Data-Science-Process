# Bivariate Exploration of Data

In this section, you will continue to develop your insights through Bivariate Visualizations. 
Bivariate Visualizations are those that involve two variables. We use Bivariate Visualizations to look at relationships when we change the level or value of one variable to see what kind of changes do we expect from the second?  

We will look at three major bivariate plots. 

* For quantitative versus quantitative variables, there are scatter plots. 

* For quantitative versus qualitative, we use violin plots. 

* For qualitative versus qualitative, we discuss clustered bar charts.
